#Dugway

**_The easy way to build Big Cartel themes._**

Dugway allows you to run your Big Cartel theme on your computer, test it in any browser, write code in your favorite editor, and use fancy new tools like CoffeeScript, Sass, and LESS. It's awesome.

##Getting Started

Getting started is easy. First off, install the **dugway** gem.

    gem install dugway

Then, start your theme, giving it a name.

    dugway create mytheme

And to see it in action, run the dugway server.

    dugway server

And that's it! You're well on your way to your very own custom-built Big Cartel theme.

For more detailed instructions, check out our **[getting started guide](/getting-started.html)** and the rest of our **[developer docs](/developer-docs.html)**.


_**Disclaimer**_

**Dugway is a very new project and likely has several bugs, rough edges, and missing features.** If you run into something weird or have a cool idea, see if it's a [known issue](https://github.com/bigcartel/dugway/issues), and otherwise [report it](https://github.com/bigcartel/dugway/issues/new) and we'll do our best to hook you up. Thanks.
